## Welcome!

Welcome to my documentation portfolio.

If you've landed here from my main [website](https://www.jccpalmer.com), then hello! You might have read about one of my projects and decided to head over here.

If you came here directly, you are likely interested in viewing my portfolio. Thank you for stopping by. Please be aware that, at this time, I am still working on this site.

Regardless, feel free to browse around and check out what I have here via the navigation menu on the left. If you've come here directly, then I encourage you to check out my [About me](about/about-me) page to learn more about who I am.

This portfolio is broken up into three main sections: Docker, Hardware, and Software. Feel free to browse to whichever section interests you. Be sure to check back soon, since I will be adding more documentation!
