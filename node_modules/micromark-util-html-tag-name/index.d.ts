/**
 * List of lowercase HTML “block” tag names.
 *
 * The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in more relaxed rules (condition
 * 6).
 * Because they are known blocks, the HTML-like syntax doesn’t have to be
 * strictly parsed.
 * For tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used
 * to detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.
